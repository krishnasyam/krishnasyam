Here’s a polished section for your README.md, including your name, a visual DevOps lifecycle, and detailed step-by-step explanations to highlight your DevOps expertise:

👋 Hi, I’m Krishnamaraju
DevOps Engineer focused on delivering cloud-native, scalable, and reliable infrastructure using AWS, Terraform, Kubernetes, and CI/CD pipelines. Passionate about automating workflows, ensuring uptime, and fostering continuous delivery.

🔄 DevOps Lifecycle Workflow
<p align="center"> <img src="./images/devops-lifecycle-1.png" alt="DevOps Lifecycle Overview" width="400" /> </p>
🚀 Key Stages in My DevOps Process
🧠 Plan

Gather requirements and set goals with stakeholders.

Define architecture, KPIs, and project roadmap.

💻 Code

Write infrastructure-as-code (Terraform), Kubernetes manifests, and application logic.

Maintain version control via Git and follow branching strategies.

🏗 Build

Automate image builds and artifact packaging using GitHub Actions or Jenkins.

Perform pre-merge checks and linting for quality control.

🔬 Test

Run unit, integration, and security tests in CI.

Ensure 100% test coverage for critical modules and vulnerability scans with tools like Snyk or SonarQube.

🚀 Release & Deploy

Use CI pipelines to push Docker images to ECR.

Apply Terraform and Helm charts to deploy on EKS.

⚙️ Operate

Use Kubernetes liveness/readiness probes for self-healing.

Manage load balancing and autoscaling with HPA and cluster autoscaler.

📈 Monitor

Collect metrics & logs with CloudWatch, Fluent Bit, and Container Insights.

Track app and infra health through dashboards.

⚠️ Feedback & Improve

Set up CloudWatch Alarms + SNS to notify on the critical events.

Use alerts and logs to iteratively refine the infrastructure and codebase.

🎯 Why This Matters
Full automation ensures reproducibility, reliability, and consistent outcomes.

CI/CD pipelines reduce manual effort and risk of human error.

Observability and alerts provide proactive incident detection and faster resolution times.
