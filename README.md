Hi there 👋

Hi there, I'm Raman! 👋
🔭 I’m currently working on a DevOps project involving a live cricket match statistics tracker. It includes advanced features like CI/CD pipelines, Docker, Kubernetes, and predictive scoring models.

🌱 I’m currently learning Cloud technologies, Kubernetes, advanced Python scripting, and manual testing to enhance my skills.

👯 I’m looking to collaborate on projects that involve Cloud and DevOps tools like Jenkins, Terraform, and Ansible, and also data analytics projects.

🤔 I’m looking for help with securing a Cloud Engineer role and optimizing the deployment process in my projects using best practices.

💬 Ask me about DevOps tools, setting up CI/CD pipelines, Cloud services (AWS), and Python scripting.
